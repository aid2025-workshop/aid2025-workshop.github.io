###### Update on Oct. 24
We are excited to announce that our program is fully integrated into the main conference's technical program! All 9 selected AID Workshop papers will be presented in a dedicated technical session open to all conference attendees.

This year's program features 9 high-quality, peer-reviewed papers divided into two specialized sessions:

**Session I: System Dependability**. This session focuses on the robustness, verification, and simulation of dependable systems, including research on cyber-deception, robustness evaluation, and attack path modeling.

**Session II: LLM-Driven Dependability**. This session dives into the role of Large Language Models in security, featuring work on automated vulnerability repair, forensic analysis, and autonomous security testing frameworks.

Each presentation is allotted a 20-minute slot, structured as a 15-minute talk followed by a 5-minute Q&A session.
