This workshop is planned as a one-day event featuring invited talks from leading researchers, peer-reviewed paper presentations, a specialized session for Korea R&D result sharing session and a panel discussion. See the workshop program schedule below.


###### Last Updated on Oct. 24
We are excited to announce that our program is fully integrated into the main conference's technical program! All 9 selected AID Workshop papers will be presented in a dedicated technical session open to all conference attendees.

This year's program features 9 high-quality, peer-reviewed papers divided into two specialized sessions:
- **Session I: System Dependability**. This session focuses on the robustness, verification, and simulation of dependable systems, including research on cyber-deception, robustness evaluation, and attack path modeling.
- **Session II: LLM-Driven Dependability**. This session dives into the role of Large Language Models in security, featuring work on automated vulnerability repair, forensic analysis, and autonomous security testing frameworks.
